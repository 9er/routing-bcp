Best Current Practices for Route- and Traffic-Filtering

The goal is to build common filters for different routing systems to do basic
filtering for BGP routes and traffic. People should be able to just
copy'n'paste the filters in their routers to achieve basic filtering of "bad"
routes and/or traffic.

This repository was started from an idea at the eco [DDoS - It's getting bigger](https://sicherheit.eco.de/2016/events/ddos-its-getting-bigger.html) workshop on the 10th of November 2016 in Frankfurt.

The first step is to gather the filters people use currently and from that
build a common filter for everyone.

If you want to contribute your filters, add them unter a
`personal-filters/<your github username>` directory.
