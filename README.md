Best Current Practices for Route- and Traffic-Filtering

The goal is to build common filters for different routing systems to do basic filtering for BGP routes and traffic. People should be able to just copy'n'paste the filters in their routers to achieve basic filtering of "bad" routes and/or traffic.

This repository was started from an idea at the eco DDoS workshop in Frankfurt.

The first step is to gather the filters people use currently and from that build a common filter for everyone.
